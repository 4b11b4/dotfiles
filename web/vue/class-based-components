# Class-Based Components in Vue with Typescript
* A class component is simply a Typescript class that extends the Vue object.
* Class-based components aren't for everyone, but if you understand them
  and enjoy working with TypeScript, then they are a more succinct and clear
  way to write components with Vue.

# Vue-Property-Decorator
* This library depends on vue-class-component and the two are meant(?) to be
  used together.
* The property decorator makes defining props, computed props, and watchers
  less verbose.
